### Understanding CHS (Cylinder-Head-Sector) Addressing

- **Cylinder (C):** Represents a track on the disk. Each cylinder consists of multiple tracks, one on each side of the disk.
- **Head (H):** Refers to the side of the disk being accessed. Floppy disks typically have two heads (0 and 1) for the two sides.
- **Sector (S):** The smallest addressable unit on the disk. Sectors are numbered starting from 1.

### Example 1: Reading a Single Sector

```asm
mov ah, 0x02      ; BIOS function to read sectors
mov al, 1         ; Number of sectors to read
mov ch, 0         ; Cylinder number (0)
mov cl, 1         ; Sector number (1, first sector)
mov dh, 0         ; Head number (0)
mov dl, 0         ; Drive number (0 for floppy A:)
mov bx, 0x8000    ; Destination buffer address
int 0x13          ; Call BIOS
jc error          ; Jump if carry flag is set (error)
```

### Example 2: Reading Multiple Sectors

```asm
mov ah, 0x02      ; BIOS function to read sectors
mov al, 3         ; Number of sectors to read
mov ch, 0         ; Cylinder number (0)
mov cl, 2         ; Starting sector number (2)
mov dh, 0         ; Head number (0)
mov dl, 0         ; Drive number (0 for floppy A:)
mov bx, 0x8000    ; Destination buffer address
int 0x13          ; Call BIOS
jc error          ; Jump if carry flag is set (error)
```

### Example 3: Reading from a Different Cylinder

```asm
mov ah, 0x02      ; BIOS function to read sectors
mov al, 1         ; Number of sectors to read
mov ch, 1         ; Cylinder number (1, second track)
mov cl, 1         ; Sector number (1)
mov dh, 0         ; Head number (0)
mov dl, 0         ; Drive number (0 for floppy A:)
mov bx, 0x8000    ; Destination buffer address
int 0x13          ; Call BIOS
jc error          ; Jump if carry flag is set (error)
```

### Example 4: Reading from the Second Head

```asm
mov ah, 0x02      ; BIOS function to read sectors
mov al, 1         ; Number of sectors to read
mov ch, 0         ; Cylinder number (0)
mov cl, 1         ; Sector number (1)
mov dh, 1         ; Head number (1, second side of the disk)
mov dl, 0         ; Drive number (0 for floppy A:)
mov bx, 0x8000    ; Destination buffer address
int 0x13          ; Call BIOS
jc error          ; Jump if carry flag is set (error)
```

### Example 5: Reading Across Cylinder Boundaries

```asm
mov ah, 0x02      ; BIOS function to read sectors
mov al, 18        ; Number of sectors to read (entire track)
mov ch, 0         ; Cylinder number (0)
mov cl, 1         ; Starting sector number (1)
mov dh, 0         ; Head number (0)
mov dl, 0         ; Drive number (0 for floppy A:)
mov bx, 0x8000    ; Destination buffer address
int 0x13          ; Call BIOS
jc error          ; Jump if carry flag is set (error)

; Now read the next track
mov ah, 0x02      ; BIOS function to read sectors
mov al, 18        ; Number of sectors to read (entire track)
mov ch, 1         ; Cylinder number (1)
mov cl, 1         ; Starting sector number (1)
mov dh, 0         ; Head number (0)
mov dl, 0         ; Drive number (0 for floppy A:)
mov bx, 0x9000    ; Destination buffer address
int 0x13          ; Call BIOS
jc error          ; Jump if carry flag is set (error)
```

### Explanation of Cylinder

- **Cylinder:** In the context of a floppy disk, a cylinder refers to a set of tracks that are vertically aligned across all platters of the disk. Each track on a cylinder is accessed by a different head.
- **Tracks and Cylinders:** Each side of a floppy disk has multiple tracks, and each track is divided into sectors. A cylinder is essentially a collection of tracks that are aligned vertically across the disk's platters.
- **Accessing Cylinders:** When you specify a cylinder number, you are selecting which track to read from on each side of the disk. The head number then determines which side of the disk you are accessing.

### Summary

- **BIOS Interrupt 13h:** Used to read sectors from a floppy disk using CHS addressing.
- **Cylinder:** Represents a track on the disk, with each cylinder containing multiple tracks (one per head).
- **Head and Sector:** Used in conjunction with the cylinder to specify the exact location of the data on the disk.

These examples demonstrate how to use BIOS interrupt 13h to read sectors from a floppy disk, allowing you to load data into RAM for further processing.
