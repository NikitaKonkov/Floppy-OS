### Floppy Disk Structure

A standard 3.5" floppy disk is organized using the CHS (Cylinder-Head-Sector) addressing scheme. Here's how it works:

1. **Cylinders:**
   - A cylinder is a set of tracks that are vertically aligned across all platters of the disk.
   - Each track on a cylinder is accessed by a different head.
   - A standard 3.5" floppy disk typically has 80 cylinders. This means there are 80 concentric circles (tracks) on each side of the disk.

2. **Heads:**
   - The head refers to the side of the disk being accessed.
   - A standard floppy disk has two heads: head 0 for the first side and head 1 for the second side.

3. **Sectors:**
   - Each track is divided into sectors, which are the smallest addressable units on the disk.
   - A standard 3.5" floppy disk has 18 sectors per track.

### CHS Addressing

- **Cylinder (C):** Refers to the track number. With 80 cylinders, the cylinder number ranges from 0 to 79.
- **Head (H):** Refers to the side of the disk. With two heads, the head number is either 0 or 1.
- **Sector (S):** Refers to the sector number on a track. With 18 sectors per track, the sector number ranges from 1 to 18.

### Example of CHS Addressing

To read a specific sector using CHS addressing, you specify the cylinder, head, and sector numbers. For example:

- **Cylinder 0, Head 0, Sector 1:** The first sector on the first track of the first side.
- **Cylinder 0, Head 1, Sector 1:** The first sector on the first track of the second side.
- **Cylinder 1, Head 0, Sector 1:** The first sector on the second track of the first side.

### Summary

- **Multiple Cylinders:** A floppy disk has multiple cylinders (typically 80), not just one. Each cylinder consists of tracks on both sides of the disk.
- **CHS Addressing:** The combination of cylinder, head, and sector numbers allows you to access any specific sector on the disk.
- **Standard Configuration:** A standard 3.5" floppy disk has 80 cylinders, 2 heads, and 18 sectors per track, resulting in a total of 2880 sectors (80 cylinders × 2 heads × 18 sectors).

This structure allows a floppy disk to store data efficiently and be accessed using the CHS addressing scheme.
